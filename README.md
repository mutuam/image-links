Create an HTML file named image_links.html.
Find or create three different images related to different topics (e.g., technology, nature, and food).
Design a webpage with the following sections:
Home: Include a welcome message and a linked image related to technology.
Gallery: Display a grid of linked images related to nature.
Menu: List food items, and each item should be linked to an image related to that food.
 Use appropriate HTML tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

 Link each image to a relevant external website (use placeholder URLs if needed).

 Ensure the page is well-structured and easy to navigate.
